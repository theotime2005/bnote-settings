# Instructions for bnote-settings project

## Processing an issue
When a request is submitted, the code to be added must respect the rest of the code base. There should be no comments unless they are necessary to clarify a situation, for example the use of a complex function.
After writing the code, the tests and the linter must all pass without errors.

## Creation of a pull request
The commits must follow the convention with the call sign and then the title of the commit. For example:
"fix: Fix the display of settings"
In the same way, pull request titles must respect this convention. In addition, the commits must be logical and follow an easy-to-understand timeline. The corrections made on a pull request after a review should not be in new commits but merged with existing ones.
